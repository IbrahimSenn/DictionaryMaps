# Phone Book Project


## My phone book project is inculudes dictionary and array exams. 

## My Task
    Given n names and phone numbers, assemble a phone book that maps friends' names to their respective phone numbers. You will then be given an unknown number of names to query your phone book for. For each name queried, print the associated entry from your phone book on a new line in the form name=phoneNumber; if an entry for name is not found, print Not found instead. 
     And input form will be like that sam 99912222 / tom 11122222 / harry 12299933 . And searching for name it will give the number, if it already have in dictionary. Else it will write the console "Not found".
